//What is JavaScript?
//JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side.

 What are the data types in JavaScript?
 JavaScript supports multiple data types, which are devided into primitive and non-primitive types. The primitive data types include:Number,String,Boolean,Null,Undefined,Symbol.

1. Number
The number type in JavaScript contains both integer and floating-point numbers. Besides regular numbers, there are also some special numbers: Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN. Infinity represents the mathematical infinity, NaN denotes a computational error.

let num = 2; // Integer
let num2 = 1.3; // Floating point number
let num3 = Infinity; // Infinity
let num4 = 'something here too'/2; // NaN

2. String
A String in JavaScript is a series of characters that are surrounded by quotes. There are three types of quotes in JavaScript: single quotes, double quotes, and backticks. Backticks provide extra functionality, allowing you to embed variables inside them.

let str = "Hello There";
let str2 = 'Single quotes works fine';
let phrase = can embed ${someVariable};


3. Boolean
The boolean type has only two values: true and false. This data type is used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

let isCoding = true; // yes
let isOld = false;      // no

4. Null
A special value that represent the absence of any object value.

let age = null;

5. Undefined
Undefined makes its own type. The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.

let x;
console.log(x);  // undefined

6. Symbol
In JavaScript, a Symbol is a primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). It is a unique and immutable value that can be used as a property key in an object.

The non-primitive types include Object, Array, and Function.

Note that BigInt is also a primitive type in JavaScript, which is used to represent big integers more accurately.
